Things to consider:

    game should probably be programmed in JS
    game should have the same rules as normal chess
    use MVC structure

    Model

        saving and loading (using JSON to transfer between different engines)
        come up with a JSON format that stores the save file independently of the game itself

    View

        multiplayer (online and pass and play) and singleplayer (vs AI) modes
        There will be a visual UI and a console based UI
        visual UI will use HTML, CSS, there should be an animation where the piece slides from one square to the next
        there will be a notice to the player if the king is in danger

    Controller

        controller (not chess engine) could be used in different programs
        AI will be a neural network, the architecture of which will be borrowed
        rules will include esoteric rules like castling, pawn promotion, and en passant
        game will have to take into account stalemate, in addition to checks and checkmate
        add timed and untimed settings and include in the save data
